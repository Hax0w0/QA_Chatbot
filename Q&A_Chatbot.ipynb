        "**Project Description**: For this project, you will build a chatbot that can answer questions about a specific topic of your choice (a sports team, favorite anime, etc.) by retrieving relevant information from the web and generating natural-language answers using a local LLM. This project is meant to serve as a very light introduction to some useful resources like Hugging Face and key concepts like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), embeddings, cosine similarity, and LLM parameters like temperature. Unlike using a pre-packaged API, this project lets you work directly with models, giving you hands-on experience with prompt design, stopping conditions, and model behavior. By the end of this project, you should have a solid starting point to build more complex, topic-specific applications.\n",

            "   Your Name explained that Mitsuha died in 2013 after the Comet Tiamat split while entering Earth’s atmosphere and hit the town of Itomori. From Mitsuha’s point of view, the comet would only hit Itomori after she switched places with Taki several times and tried to visit him in Tokyo. From Taki’s point of view, the destruction of Itomori by the comet happened three years before he switched bodies with Mitsuha.\n",
            "\n",
            "   Several fragments of a comet fall through the sky. Most of them won’t collide with Earth, but one breaks off and hurtles directly towards the town of Itomori. Soon, everybody there will be vanquished. The parents, the children, the teachers, the politicians, the businessmen will all be gone.\n",
            "\n",
            "   Remember my theory about the first comet? That it shares both a divine and a metaphorical connection with the future comet that will destroy Itomori. Just like Taki and Mitsuha, the past and future comets that will strike Itomori are bound together, regardless of space or time. Just like there is a link between the lake and the shrine, there is an unbreakable bond shared between two young people in love.\n",
            "\n",
            "   Even though the first comet isn’t given much attention in the movie, I think it’s important to address that first comet, as I think it shares both a divine and a metaphorical connection with the future comet that will destroy Itomori.\n",
            "\n",
            "   When Taki and Mitsuha finally meet, their bodies travel through time to finally converge in the same time and space. This occurs at twilight (aka tasogare-doki) when their worlds blur together. Even though they’re three years apart, the connection between the first comet and the second comet that destroyed Itomori has allowed for two different timelines to merge—the world with Itomori, and the world without Itomori.\n",
            "\n",
            "   It could be that two different comets struck Earth at two different points in time, but I’ll assume that, based on what happens to present-day Itomori, that the first comet split into several fragments as well. One of those fragments created the lake that Itomori would one day rest upon, and the other established a crater that houses the Miyamizu Shrine.\n",
            "\n",
            "   Think of the first comet splitting into two parts as a severed connection between two people—this is a key metaphor for the love shared between Mitsuha and Taki. The bond those two comet fragments share creates an otherworldly link between the lake and the shrine, and Mitsuha and Taki must use that connection to save Itomori from the future comet.\n",

There is an apparently mystical connection between Itomori and Comet Tiamat, one stretching for potentially thousands of years. For unknown reasons, every time the comet approaches Earth, a piece of itself always mysteriously breaks off and crashes somewhere around the area that would later become Itomori. The last time it appeared, a fragment broken from the comet crashed into the area that would become Itomori during the Upper Palaeolithic, forming Lake Itomori.\n",
